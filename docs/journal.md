# Graphirm Decision Journal

Why things are the way they are. `docs/completion-log.md` records **what** shipped;
this file records **why** — decisions, rejected alternatives, and reversals.
Newest entry first. One entry per decision, not per session.

Add an entry whenever a choice is made that a future reader could not reconstruct from
the code or the plan alone: architecture, dependency, convention, measured trade-off,
something tried and abandoned. Skip routine work.

## 2026-09-28 — Pi subprocess wrapper: drain to EOF, receiver-drop discards, handle+JoinHandle shape

**Context:** `delegate_pi` (plan A2.5) runs `pi --mode json` as a child and turns its JSONL stdout
into `PiEvent`s. Four things about Pi 0.85.1 shaped the wrapper: it auto-retries transient provider
errors (`agent_end {willRetry:true}` → `auto_retry_start` → `agent_start` …), so `agent_end` is not
a terminator; it parses a leading `@` in a positional argument as a file reference (`Error: File not
found`, exit 1); its `bash` tool can leave a backgrounded grandchild holding the stdout pipe after Pi
itself has exited; and a consumer that stops reading events would, through a bounded channel and a
full 64 KiB pipe, stall Pi until the deadline and misreport `Timeout`.
**Decision:** (1) Read stdout to EOF and then wait for exit; `AgentEnd` is forwarded like any other
event and never ends the read loop. (2) A dropped or closed event receiver flips the reader into
*discard* mode instead of stopping it, so Pi can never block on a full pipe; `PiRunHandle::wait()`
closes the receiver first — "wait" means "stop consuming". (3) The public shape is
`spawn_pi(spec, cancel) -> PiRunHandle { events: mpsc::Receiver<PiEvent>, done: JoinHandle<..> }`
rather than an async `on_event` callback; the tool layer (A2.7) awaits graph writes between
`recv()`s, and `process.rs` stays free of graph/judge concerns. Dropping the handle aborts the
driver; a `GroupKillGuard` armed in `spawn_pi` right after `child.id()` SIGKILLs the whole process
group when the driver future is dropped — armed at spawn, not in the driver, because a handle dropped
before the driver's first poll never runs driver code. (4) Tasks longer than 64 KiB *or* starting
with `@` are written to a `0600` `create_new` temp file and passed as
`-- @<path> "Carry out the task described in the attached file."`; the file is removed when the run
ends. (5) After exit, the pipes get `POST_EXIT_GRACE` (3 s, capped by the remaining deadline) to
close; on expiry the group is killed and the run still returns `Ok` with the exit code and
`pipes_lingered: true` — Pi *did* finish; a straggler is a warning, not a failure. (6) Pi's env is
the inherited env plus `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1` minus `GRAPHIRM_API_KEY`; the provider key is Pi's
own business (`~/.pi/agent/auth.json` / provider env vars) and is never read or logged.
**Alternatives:** Stop reading at `agent_end` — wrong under auto-retry and races the exit. Stop the
reader when the receiver drops — deadlocks Pi on a full pipe; the "caller must cancel" contract was
too easy to violate (the reviewer hit it by calling `wait()` without draining). Async callback API —
forces graph I/O into the process layer and makes cancel/timeout tests awkward. Returning `Timeout`
when a straggler holds the pipe after a clean exit — loses the exit code for a condition Pi is not
responsible for. Passing `--fake-knob` env through `spawn_pi` — rejected; the fake reads knobs from
argv (`PiConfig.extra_args`) so `spawn_pi` never takes arbitrary env and tests stay parallel-safe.
**Consequences:** `PiRunHandle` has a `Drop` impl, so it cannot be destructured; consumers use
`handle.events.recv()` + `handle.wait()`. Under `pipes_lingered` the last stdout lines may be lost
(the reader is aborted); counters and the stderr tail survive via shared atomics/mutex. A pgid is
never signalled after the direct child has been reaped except through the explicit
`kill_group_and_reap` path (same pid-reuse caveat as `bash`). The `@` rule means a task that
legitimately starts with an `@mention` still works — via the file.

## 2026-09-28 — `bash` children run in their own process group and are SIGKILLed as a group on cancel/timeout

**Context:** `BashTool` cancelled by `task.abort()` on a `tokio::spawn`ed `wait_with_output`.
That drops the future but never signals the OS process: the `bash -c` shell and everything it
forked (`sleep 30`, `npm run dev &`, …) kept running after the agent gave up. Task A1.4 fixed
this now because `delegate_pi` (A2.5) needs the identical kill-on-cancel pattern.
**Decision:** Spawn the shell with `process_group(0)` + `kill_on_drop(true)`, `stdin(null)`;
capture `child.id()` immediately after `spawn()` as the pgid; on timeout, cancel, or an I/O error
from the reader, call `graphirm_tools::process::kill_group_and_reap(&mut child, pgid)` — an
explicit `libc::kill(-pgid, SIGKILL)`, then `start_kill()` as portable fallback, then `wait()`
under a 5 s reap timeout. `libc` is a new `[target.'cfg(unix)'.dependencies]` of
`graphirm-tools` (already in the lock file via tokio). The pgid is captured at spawn because
`child.id()` is `None` once the shell has been reaped — exactly the "shell exited, grandchild
still holds the pipe" case the group kill exists for.
**Alternatives:** (a) `start_kill()` alone — kills the shell but orphans grandchildren; proven
by `cancel_kills_the_shells_descendants`, which fails without the group kill. (b) Shelling out
to `kill -9 -- -<pgid>` (no `libc` dep) — first implementation; rejected because `kill(1)` is
absent from the `debian:bookworm-slim` runtime image (no `procps`), so the spawn failed with
ENOENT, was swallowed, and descendants still leaked in production. (c) Inherited stdin — with
the shell in a background process group a child reading the tty would get SIGTTIN and hang
until timeout; null stdin gives a deterministic EOF.
**Consequences:** bash children no longer receive the terminal's SIGINT/SIGHUP — acceptable
because the TUI is raw-mode (Ctrl-C is an event, not a signal) and `serve` cancels sessions on
SIGINT. `serve` still ignores SIGTERM, so a hard `pkill -f 'graphirm serve'` leaves live
sessions' children detached (backlog, S·P2). `process.rs` is the reference implementation for
`delegate_pi`'s kill path; A2.5 reuses it instead of adding `libc` to `graphirm-agent`.

`crates/tools/src/bash.rs`; commits `136c7af` (kill(1) version) and its follow-up.

## 2026-09-28 — Pi becomes the delegated coding executor; graphirm stays the director

**Context:** Graphirm has the control plane (Jev routing in shadow, HITL judge, graph memory,
pinned rules) but its in-process `delegate` is unreachable from the server and TUI, and the
agent loop's own coding ability is what `graphirm-eval` measures. Codeporate already drives Pi
(`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) via `--mode json` with a Python event mapper. A director
without a strong executor and an executor without a control plane are complementary.

**Decision:** Pi is the only external executor, run as one subprocess per delegation in
`--mode json`, observe-only (its tool calls are recorded and judged, not paused). Its work is
graph-native: Task + Pi Agent + `Interaction{role:"tool"}` nodes in the same shape in-process
tools produce. Live visibility comes from a new optional `ToolEventSink` on `ToolContext`.
Design with 15 sub-decisions: `docs/plans/2026-09-28-pi-delegate-executor-design.md`.

**Alternatives:** Hermes as executor — rejected: it is a second director with its own memory
and routing, leaving Jev no seat. Gating Pi's calls in v1 via `--mode rpc` or a Pi extension —
deferred: observe first, keep the parser process-agnostic so the switch is additive.
`GraphUpdate`-on-insert instead of a sink — rejected: the `EventBus` is per prompt and the
graph store has no channel, so there is nothing to emit from.

**Consequences:** `ToolContext` gains a field (21 mechanical edits). A new `[agent.pi]` config
block, disabled until the A4 live check passes. Track B (phone-first chat) is designed only
after A4. Nothing in context selection, compaction, memory ranking, or knowledge extraction
changes.

## 2026-09-28 — Governance docs must be updated in the same commit as the work

**Context:** Audit found the scaffolding (root + 7 scoped `AGENTS.md`, 3 Cursor rules, hooks,
1,500-line backlog, completion log) was mature but drifting: `backlog.md` header said
"Phases 0–35" while `AGENTS.md` said 0–55; `docs/README.md` was stuck at Phase 12;
`CHANGELOG.md` frozen since 2026-03-08; ~60% of `backlog.md` was completed items despite the
file's own convention to move them out. Root cause: no rule, hook, or skill obliged anyone to
update these files. The only doc-update obligation (`000-skills-first.mdc` → update
`00-execution-strategy.md`) pointed at a document abandoned in March. No decision journal existed.

**Decision:** Extend `.cursor/rules/000-skills-first.mdc` with a "Governance docs" block —
plan link on start, ✅ + completion-log entry on ship, journal entry on non-obvious decisions,
backlog entry for discovered-but-unstarted work — all in the same commit as the work. Drop the
`00-execution-strategy.md` line. Create this file. Add a pointer block to `AGENTS.md` because
`.cursor/` is gitignored and only `AGENTS.md` reaches the spoke and other clones.

**Alternatives:** (a) A separate `200-governance.mdc` rule — rejected; the existing rule already
owns "commit and progress rules", and a fourth always-apply rule adds context cost for no
isolation benefit. (b) A pre-commit hook that fails when `crates/` changes without a
`docs/` change — deferred; too blunt for refactors and hotfixes, revisit if drift recurs.
(c) ADR directory (`docs/decisions/NNNN-*.md`) instead of a single journal — rejected for now;
one file is easier to grep and append to at the current decision rate.

**Consequences:** Every agent session that ships anything now touches at least two docs. The
known drift (backlog header, `docs/README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, stale `src/main.rs` pointers in
`AGENTS.md`) is **not** fixed by this entry — it is separate cleanup work.

**Refs:** `.cursor/rules/000-skills-first.mdc`, `AGENTS.md` → Governance docs, commit `85ffc1a`
(same day: phase table moved out of `AGENTS.md` into `completion-log.md`).
